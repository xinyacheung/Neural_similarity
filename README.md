# Neural_similarity
processing neural data and classifying the border of color and motion 

#classification: [data] is the data we'd like to classify. {border:color or motion}_time_series_{region}_{bin_size} & {border:color or motion}_label_{region}_{bin_size}

#data processing: get the spike counts for each region over time bins and trials.
